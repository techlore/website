Official repo for the Techlore website.

## Contributing
    
This website uses HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. It doesn't have any dependencies.

*But why? We all know that frameworks are awesome, but for a big project like this with a lot of pages and resources - we decided that using only small libraries and pure Web development is perfect to balance the speed with the content in a clean and simple design.*
