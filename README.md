## Installation and local development
Because we are using a static website generator, the installation requires a little bit more work.

### Jekyll
For Jekyll installation follow the instruction on the [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

### Node.js 22.x:
We also need Node to install the latest version of Bulma.

#### MacOs / Linux
> - installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
	`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash`
> - download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
	`nvm install 22`
> - verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
	`node -v` should print `v22.9.0`
> - verifies the right npm version is in the environment
	`npm -v` should print `10.8.3`

ℹ️ _Installation instructions for all platforms are available on the [NodeJS.org website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)_

### Bulma framework installation
The final step is to run `npm install`.

### View website locally
Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and the site should be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
