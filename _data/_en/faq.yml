  title: "Is coaching for me?"
  desc: |
    It depends.

    Coaching can save you months (or years) of headache. We analyze your physical and digital life to give you clear, individualized support based on years of experience and research. Many clients have found the service invaluable in achieving their goals.

    While the service is helpful for many people—we don't want you to think you can only be successful with our service. We also have countless free resources for those who prefer that avenue.

  title: "What can I expect?"

    Coaching varies depending on the individual, but for most clients it's a fairly involved process. We listen to your questions & goals, deep-dive into your digital and physical life to understand who you are, form an individualized plan to accomplish those goals, then execute. **We don't recommend proceeding if you're not ready for the commitment!** _(If you're on the fence, there's a free 15 minute consultation where we answer any questions about coaching)_

    Some clients prefer an information-dense single session, where they ask all their questions for quick responses. Some clients prefer working together across several sessions over a period of time for a more thorough experience walking through the journey together. We're flexible and want to make sure you're only paying for what you need.

    Techlore Coaching does not perform tasks assigned to you. _(Ex. We may instruct you to delete certain accounts, but you are still responsible for implementing the advice)_

  title: "What is threat modeling?"
  desc: "Threat modeling refers to \"the process of identifying, understanding, and communicating risks and mitigation to protect something of value\".
  With countless people screaming different things you need to do to protect yourself, it becomes difficult to sift through what truly applies to you. We get personal and figure out exactly what you are trying to protect, then give you individualized options on how to achieve it. We don't believe there's a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to privacy & security."

  title: "How is my information protected?"
  desc: "Protecting your information is our utmost priority. Our [privacy policy]([[privacyPolicyUrl]]) outlines how we protect your data."
